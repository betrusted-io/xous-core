# This specifies the SVD rev for platform targets
# Precursor is an FPGA, so the actual hardware register spec can change over time,
# hence the gitrev is specified as part of the precursor feature spec. We specify
# every gitrev that we may need to refer back to, so that we're not trying to
# map utralib version numbers to precursor soc revs -- by having the gitrev exposed,
# we can directly look up what generated the SVD file we're using without having
# to go through some manually maintained lookup table of version # to gitrev.
#
# SoCs in custom silicon would typically not need the gitrev, since their
# hardware is immutable.
#
# Maintainer note: add checks in build.rs to ensure only one is selected.

# The SVD gitrev as specified above is only invoked to track fine-grained
# changes between target revisions. Below is the overall target switch,
# which is the preferred mechanism for isolating target-specific code.
#
# These features are mutually exclusive. Maintainers should update the
# checks inside build.rs to ensure consistency.
