/*
  Soft AES implementations vendored in from https://github.com/RustCrypto/block-ciphers.git
  Commit ref 7de364ede310f1ea7080c99ddf1138aeb47f9a69 0.8.1
  License is MIT/Apache 2.0.

  Soft AES is mainly here for validation/benchmarking comparison against the Vex-accelerated primitives
  and to help with API development. Core crypto primitives are vendored in so that the code is explicitly
  managed within Xous and not pulled in as a dependency that can be changed/poisoned on the fly. It also
  eliminates another foreign build.rs script that runs on the local build machine.
