///////// Ping implementation
/// smoltcp's ICMP stack is a little weird. It's designed with an icmp packet
/// formatter, but it's built into the socket handle itself. The reasoning behind
/// this was to keep memory allocations small and static.
///
/// In a single-threaded implementation, one would normally have no problem simply
/// pulling up the socket handle and jamming or unpacking data using that handle.
/// Unfortunately, in Xous, we want to keep smoltcp inside the Net crate, and not
/// have it bleed into other parts of the OS. The first take at implementing this
/// thus ended up having to duplicate the storage for ICMP into the "lib" side code,
/// and using the smoltcp convenience functions to create and format packets.
///
/// This ugly division of labor leads to an unweildy handler prone to locking
/// and object lifetime issues. There's two options on how to work our way out of this.
/// 1. One is to re-implement ICMP packet packing and unpacking inside Xous, so that smoltcp is just a raw
///    ICMP packet pusher.
/// 2. Make the Xous Net interface to ICMP specific to "ping", pushing sequence numbers and origin timestamps
///    into the Net crate, and getting back sequence numbers with the corresponding timestamps.
///
/// The downside of (1) is duplication of effort. ICMP is fairly straightforward for
/// IPv4, but unfortunately for IPv6 it requires knowledge of the source address
/// which puts a burden on coordinating DHCP updates into the implementation.
/// The downside of (2) is it makes things a little awkward later on if someone
/// wants to implement fancy ICMP protocol hacks in the Net stack.
///
/// However, it looks like there is a clean place to hook a traceroute implementation
/// into the smoltcp stack, as it has a parser for TimeExceeded packts built in,
/// and we could provide a hook for that, and perhaps a Traceroute utility that
/// exists in parallel to the Ping implementation on the "lib" side of the Net crate.
///
/// Thus for this refactor, we are going to push more function of ICMP parsing and
/// formatting into the "main" side of the Net crate and thus into the ICMP socket
/// implementation, and leave the client side a bit more naive & high-level, functioning
/// closer to a full utility. This is unlike the UDP and TCP implementations, which
/// are ignorant of what's being done with them.
