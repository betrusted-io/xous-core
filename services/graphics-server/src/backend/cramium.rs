//! # Display backend for Cramium target
//!
//! There isn't a dedicated memory LCD frame buffer device, so it has to be
//! cobbled together somewhat painfully from a DMA engine and the PIO block.
//!
//! The drawing frame buffer is laid out as 11 words by 536 lines.
//!
//! Each line has 16 extra bits on the MSB of the last word that are used to
//! indicate if the line is dirty.
//!
//! Drawing frame buffer:
//! 0x0000: [data 0, data 1, ... data 0A, data 0B | dirty << 16],
//! 0x000C: [data C, data D, ... data 15, data 16 | dirty << 16],
//! ...
//!
//! The PIO is "dumb" in that it can only shift bits out; however, the memory
//! LCD requires addressing and mode set information on each line. In order
//! to accommodate this, the top 16 unused bits of the previous line is used
//! to encode the addressing and mode set information, referred to as `addr`
//! in the schematic below.
//!
//! So, in the redraw routine, the drawing frame buffer is checked line-by-line
//! to see if the line is dirty; if it is, it is copied to the HW DMA buffer,
//! such that the line *prior* to the current line has the addressing bits
//! for the LCD inserted in the top 16 bits. This means that the first line
//! in the HW DMA buffer is mostly dummy words, plus the address of the first
//! line:
//!
//! HW DMA buffer:
//! 0x0000: [dummy 0, dummy 1, .... dummy 0A, dummy 0B | addr 0 << 16],
//! 0x0030: [data  0,  data 1, .... data  0A, data  0B | addr 1 << 16],
//! ...
//!
//! The HW DMA buffer will only contain the dirty lines to blit. Thus, when
//! passing the blit initiation command off to the `cram-hal-service` server,
//! the number of lines to blit must be specified.
//!
//! There are two implementations currently contemplated: one using the PL230+PIO
//! block, and the other using the UDMA block.
//!
//! ## PL230+PIO:
//!
//! The PL230 DMA engine is configured to copy only the specified number
//! of half-words (where a half-word is 16 bits in length) into the PIO block,
//! computed as (23 half-words per line) * (number of lines), with the first
//! half-word originating at the addressing bits on the previous line. Thus the
//! DMA would start at address 0xA, shifting 16 bits of `addr 0` first, then
//! 22 16-bit words consisting of 352 bits of line data, and a final 16 bits of
//! "don't care" (which turns out to be the next line's address info).
//!
//! The PIO engine is configured as a simple 16-bit, LSB-first shift register
//! to send data to the LCD at a rate of 2 MHz, requesting a new word via DMA
//! whenever the shift register is empty. Multi-line mode is used to drive
//! the LCD, so CS should be manually de-asserted at the conclusion of the transfer.
//! In this implementation, setup time on CS is enforced by the PIO with a short
//! pre-amble.
//!
//! ## UDMA:
//!
//! The UDMA engine is configured to send only the specified number of half-words
//! (where a half-word is 16 bits in length) into the SPIM block. I think the CS
//! line should still be managed through a GPIO bit-bang operation, since there
//! is a fairly long setup/hold time requirement on it and there does not seem
//! to be a provision in the UDMA block to put guardbands around the CS timing.
