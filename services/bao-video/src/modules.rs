/// This function takes a fraction described as `m.n`, where n is a fraction out of 1024, as well
/// as an `end` value, and returns numbers going from `0..end` such that with each
/// call of `next()` you produce a usize index in the range of `0..end` that is the
/// nearest algebraic integer that would result from adding the value `m.n` to the
/// current iteration count.
///
/// Thus, a value of 1.5 would be passed as m=1, n=512 (as 512/1024 = 0.5).
///
/// This "iterator" is not guaranteed to return every element in the range of `0..end`,
/// and in fact some numbers may not be returned at all, including `0` or `end-1`. However,
/// it does guarantee that the output is monatomically increasing, unless an error signal
/// is injected that is big enough to cause the count to go backwards.
///
/// Features that we might need:
///   - A report of the "error sign", expressed as +1, 0, -1, which expresses the direction
///    in which we're rounding. For example, 6.3 would be returned as 6 with an error of +1.
///    whereas 6.9 would be returned as 7 with an error of -1.
///   - The ability to inject an error correction signal into the fractional counter. This
///    if the loop internally concludes that an error signal would produce a more accurate
///    sub-pixel sampling, the error count would be applied at that iteration so that subsequent
///    indices absorb the delta into their future counts.
