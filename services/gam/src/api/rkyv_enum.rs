// As of Rust 1.64.0:
//
// Rkyv-derived enums throw warnings that rkyv::Archive derived enums are never used
// and I can't figure out how to make them go away. Since they spam the build log,
// rkyv-derived enums are now isolated to their own file with a file-wide `dead_code`
// allow on top.
//
// This might be a temporary compiler regression, or it could just
// be yet another indicator that it's time to upgrade rkyv. However, we are waiting
// until rkyv hits 0.8 (the "shouldn't ever change again but still not sure enough
// for 1.0") release until we rework the entire system to chase the latest rkyv.
// As of now, the current version is 0.7.x and there isn't a timeline yet for 0.8.
