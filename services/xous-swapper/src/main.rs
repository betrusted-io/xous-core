// TODO: redo docs to match streamlined architecture

//! ==Architecture==
//!
//! The Xous philosophy is to leave the kernel lightweight and free of dependencies. The swap implementation
//! adheres to this by trying to move as much of the difficult algorithmic processing and performance tuning
//! outside of the kernel.
//!
//! The one thing swap does introduce to the kernel that is algorithm-y is a renormalization routine for
//! counting page accesses. We track page access frequency with a 32-bit "epoch" counter, which is simply
//! incremented whenever a page table interaction happens. We don't use a 64-bit counter because greatly
//! increases the memory used to track things due to the single 64-bit record forcing the next item to also
//! have 64-bit alignment, thus effectively wasting several bytes per page. Anyways, when the epoch is about
//! to roll-over, a mostly in-place sweep with no allocations beyond a few dozen bytes in stack is done to the
//! memory usage tracker to "compact" the epoch numbers down. There is a #[test] in the kernel crate for this
//! routine.
//!
//! In order to perform all the other processing outside of the kernel, the swapper introduces a special new
//! "blocking userspace handler". It's "IRQ-like", in that it borrows the same mechanism used for blocking
//! IRQ handlers, but with different entry and exit magic numbers so we can differentiate the two. The
//! blocking userspace handler happens with interrupts disabled, giving it an atomic view of all of memory for
//! the duration of the handler.
//!
//! == Measuring Memory Usage ==
//!
//! The swapper needs to come up with an answer for which page to swap out, and it
//! also needs to know when to do it (OOM pressure).
//!
//! OOM pressure is handled with a syscall to the kernel to query the current `MEMORY_ALLOCATIONS`
//! table and return the available RAM. This is queried periodically with a timer, and if we
//! fall below a certain threshold, the swapper will force a pre-emptive OOM.
//!
//! When the `swap` feature is selected, `MEMORY_ALLOCATIONS` is upgraded from a `u8` to a table of
//! `timestamp | VPN | PID | FLAGS`, where the timestamp is a u32 that is monotonically
//! incremented with every modification to the page, and the VPN | PID | FLAGS portion
//! is condensed to fit into a u32. The FLAGS can specify if the address is `wired`, which
//! would be the case of e.g. a page table page, and the VPN would be considered invalid
//! in this case (and the page should never be swapped).
//!
//! A u32 is used instead of a u64 because due to alignment issues, if we used a u64 we'd
//! waste 4 bytes per tracking slot, and the penalty is not worth it in a memory-constrained
//! system. Instead, we have a callback to handle when the "epoch" rolls over.
//!
//! The `MEMORY_ALLOCATIONS` table is page-aligned, so that it can be mapped into PID 2 inside
//! an interrupt context. To initiate OOM handling, PID 2 is invoked by the kernel with a call the swapper
//! interrupt context with `MEMORY_ALLOCATIONS` mapped into its memory space. At this point, PID 2 will copy
//! the current `MEMORY_ALLOCATIONS` table into a pre-allocated BinaryHeap in the shared state structure,
//! indexed by the timestamp. At this point, the blocking userspace handler can work through a sorted vector
//! of allocations to pick the pages it wants to remove.
