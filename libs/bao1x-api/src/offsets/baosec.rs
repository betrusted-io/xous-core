/// device secret key.

/// authorization certificate which upon receipt would blank the device and unlock various
/// features for debugging failed hardware.
pub const RMA_KEY: SlotIndex = SlotIndex::Key(257, PartitionAccess::Fw0, RwPerms::ReadOnly);

/// to developer mode.

/// `NUISANCE_KEYS` are hashed together with `ROOT_SEED` to derive the core secret.
/// Their primary purpose is to annoy microscopists trying to read the secret key by
/// directly imaging the RRAM array. They also exist to reduce power side channels
/// created upon accessing keys in combination with `CHAFF_KEYS`. Note there is ECC
/// on the data (2C2D on top of 128 bits) so any readout with better than 97% accuracy
/// can trivially rely on ECC to repair the results (and now you have a metric for how
/// reliable your readout needs to be).
///
/// The placement is picked based upon two competing theories:
///   - Data stored next to each other will be harder to read out because the simultaneous activation of
///     read-out word line transistors via secondary electron leakage will cause the data in adjacent cells to
///     super-impose on the bitline. You want to have several random bits superimposed to defeat probabilistic
///     models of leakage behavior.
///   - Data stored far from each other will be harder to read out based on the difficulty of achieving
///     flatness & uniformity in delayering over long distances.
///
/// Thus 2x 4k pages on either end of the key range are carved out for the nuisance keys. 4k page size
/// is convenient because that's the natural page size over which the key range will be carved up before
/// handing to other processes.
///
/// The first 8 keys in bank 0 of NUISANCE_KEYS is not used. This is because due to an ECO in the A1
/// spin of silicon, the JTAG-wired access control on these is going to be tied to those on the similarly
/// numbered data slots. Some of the data slots in the first 8 slots will be read-only at CP time, and
/// thus they can't be initialized with random data and be used as a nuisance key. This is a minor degradation

/// The read-out data is XOR'd together into a single 256-bit key, and then hashed into
/// the key. The reason for this procedure is if there are strong power side channels in
/// the key read-out, the CHAFF_KEYS have a random ordering that frustrates attempts to
/// correlate the power signature over repeated reboots. The read-out of the CHAFF_KEYS
/// needs to be strictly constant time, i.e. the permutation function can't leak a
/// side channel that reveals what the ordering is. Better yet, CHAFF_KEYS can be read
/// out interleaved with the NUISANCE_KEY readout, where the selection to read a CHAFF_KEY
/// or a NUISANCE_KEY is done randomly, thus introducing some disorder in the power side
/// channel timing of the NUISANCE_KEY readout.

/// bits. But this is enough bits that it should make the original key unrecoverable. Once
