/// This is the "user" of the trusted process. There's four regions defined which have

///   1. Read/write control of a hardware-defined region of the main RRAM array. These are hard-defined
///      constants burned into a bank of memory that is only accessible at wafer probe, and then is sealed.
///      The main use of this r/w control is actually just to enforce read-only for the 'boot0' region, so
///      that the public keys that verify a firmware image can't be modified.
///   2. Access control of a key or data slot. These are managed by a totally different piece of hardware,
///      even though the naming terminology is the same. In the case of the RV32 CPU, the mapping of the four
///      possible regions are dynamically mapped using a LUT, from a given ASID (address space ID) to one of
///      teh four user states. An exploit chain would nominally need to gain code execution in machine mode
///      (e.g. the kernel) to modify the ASID; an ASID-mod gadget can force any process to masquerade as the
///      'trusted' process.
///
/// In the context for this constant, we are defining (2), i.e., the trusted user target for the access
/// control hardware. Note that boot0 is the default boot state of the machine - so in theory, the bootloader
/// doesn't (easily) have access to the key slots. Nominally one would need to boot into Xous and run
/// the `keystore`; but of course, in bootloader (machine mode), you have the power to conjure any ASID
/// out of thin air so with arbitrary code exec in bootloader one can bypass the controls.
///
/// Thus there are two attack surfaces of concern: the bootloader, and the kernel. Arbitrary code execution
/// in either environment is game over for the hardware access control.
