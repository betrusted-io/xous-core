# Legal Notices

This project includes bitmap glyphs from several typefaces.

There are important legal distinctions between bitmap glyphs and vector
font files. To the best of my knowledge, in the U.S. and many other
jurisdictions, bitmap typeface glyphs (shapes of letters) are generally not
subject to copyright or design patent protection as long as the typeface is
at least 25 years old.

Many of the bitmap glyphs used in this project originated in old-school
bitmap fonts, which were subsequently packaged as .ttf vector fonts, which
I used to create sprite sheets, from which I extracted bitmap sprites.

For bitmap glyphs created from a workflow that used vector fonts, I
preserved the copyright and license details from the vector fonts. I am not
a lawyer, so I'm not sure if the vector font licenses still apply to those
bitmap glyphs.

In any case, I encourage people who use blitstr2 to preserve these legal
notices in derivative works.


## Latin Typeface Glyphs: Chicago, Geneva, Courier

This project includes bitmap glyphs from the Chicago and Geneva typefaces
which were designed by Susan Kare and released by Apple in 1984. Chicago and
Geneva are registered trademarks of Apple Inc. The PNG sprite sheets of Chicago
and Geneva glyphs came from screenshots taken on Macintosh System 7, with
additional Latin Extended characters added by Sam Blenny.

This project includes bitmap glyphs from the Courier typeface which was
designed by Howard G. "Bud" Kettler in the 1950's for use with IBM
typewriters. The PNG sprite sheet of Courier glyphs came from a screenshot
taken on Macintosh System 7, with additional Latin Extended characters added
by Sam Blenny.


## Emoji and Hanzi Bitmap Glyphs: Unifont 14

This project includes bitmap glyphs for emoji and hanzi which were extracted from PNG
sprite sheet documents created using the Unifont 14 font, unifont-14.0.01.ttf and
unifont_upper-14.0.01.ttf, as downloaded from
https://unifoundry.com/pub/unifont/unifont-14.0.01/font-builds/ in December 2021.

Unifont 14 is dual-licensed under the SIL Open Font License (OFL) version 1.1
and the GNU GPL 2+ with the GNU font embedding exception.

**This code is using Unifont 14 under the SIL OFL-1.1 option.**

This project uses a list of emoji codepoints derived from the Unicode Data Files for
Unicode 14, as downloaded from https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/14.0/emoji-sequences.txt
in January 2022.

This project uses a list of hanzi codepoints derived from the Unicode Data Files for
Unicode 14, Unihan_DictionaryLikeData.txt, extracted from the
https://www.unicode.org/Public/14.0.0/ucd/Unihan.zip zip archive, as downloaded in
January 2022.

## Japanese Bitmap Glyphs: JF Dot Izumi Gothic

This project includes bitmap glyphs extracted from a PNG sprite sheet document created
using the JF Dot Izumi Gothic 16 and JF Dot Izumi Gothic 16 Bold fonts,
JF-Dot-Izumi16.ttf and JF-Dot-Izumi16B.ttf, as downloaded from
http://jikasei.me/font/jf-dotfont/ in November 2021.

As I understand it, JF Dot Izumi is licensed under the closest equivalent of Public
Domain that is possible under Japanese copyright law, which is a bit different
than under US copyright law.


### JF Dot Izumi Gothic Description and License

"Description" extracted with `otfinfo` from JF-Dot-Izumi16.ttf (same as JF-Dot-Izumi16B.ttf):
```
このフォントファイルは、ビットマップフォント「出水16ドットゴシック」を、
自家製フォント工房 (http://jikasei.me/) がアウトライン化された TrueType フォントに変換したものです。
```

"License Description" extracted with `otfinfo` from JF-Dot-Izumi16.ttf  (same as
JF-Dot-Izumi16B.ttf):
```
出水ビットマップフォントシリーズに関するあらゆる権利は、特定の個人／団体の形で保持することを主張しません。
現状では書体に著作権は認められていませんが(プログラムの権利と主張する向きもあるが、現状ではかなり疑問が残る)、
たとえ未来に書体の著作権が認められた場合でもその著作権がすべてのユーザに共有され、
自由に流通・改変されることを希望します。つまりパブリックドメインに準ずることを宣言します。
なお、著作権以外でもその他の権利の存在がありうるかもしれませんが、権利の行使は可能な限り控えさせていただきます。

追記。改正不正競争防止法第2条第1項第1号によると、書体を商品等表示と考えることで、
無期限(ちなみによく知られている3号型は3年)に保護されるのではないかと考えられます。
なおこの条項は旧不正競争防止法第1条第1項第1号に相当するので昭和十年以来有効です。

また、このフォントが商用利用・非営利利用を問わず自己責任の下に利用されることを希望します。その際、
商品の明細等に出水書体を使用した旨の記載の義務は存在しませんし(ただし、改変部分などに権利等を主張する場合は、
その及ぶ範囲を明示しておかないとならないでしょう)、私自身への連絡の義務はありません。ただし、
私自身は使用書体の記載は、公共性の観点から考えて望ましいと考えていますし、
私自身への利用の報告は今後の開発に役立てるのに重要だと考えています。
