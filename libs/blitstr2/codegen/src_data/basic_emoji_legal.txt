// SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
// -----------------------------------------------------------
//
// PREAMBLE
// The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
// development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
// efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
// open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
// with others.
//
// The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
// redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
// fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
// redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
// names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
// however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
// requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
// to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
//
// DEFINITIONS

// Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may

// copyright statement(s).
//
// "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
