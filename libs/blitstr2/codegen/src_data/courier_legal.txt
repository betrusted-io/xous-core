// This code includes encoded bitmaps of glyphs from the Courier typeface which
// was designed by Howard G. "Bud" Kettler in the 1950's for use with IBM
// typewriters. The PNG sprite sheet of Courier glyphs came from a screenshot
// taken on Macintosh System 7, with additional Latin Extended characters added
// by Sam Blenny.
