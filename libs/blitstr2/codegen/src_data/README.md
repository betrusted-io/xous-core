# codegen source data

The `*.png` and `*.codepoint` files in this directory are mostly copies of output files
from scripts in https://github.com/samblenny/hd1b_other. The `.codepoint` files list
hex format Unicode codepoints that correspond to a row-major order traversal of the
corresponding `.png` glyph sprite sheets.

To update the sprite sheets for additional glyph coverage, start by taking a look at
https://github.com/samblenny/hd1b_other.
