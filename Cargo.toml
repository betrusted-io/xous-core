######################################################
### PATCHES TO DEV/TEST XOUS KERNEL CODE
###
### The kernel is published to crates.io, and all the packages in Xous are configured to get
### the kernel from crates.io and NOT the local tree.
###
### When making changes to the kernel, you must activate some or all of the patches below
### for the local sources to "see" the changes.
### You will also need to compile with `--no-verify` to acknowledge that you are doing local
### source development and accept that what's on crates.io doesn't match what's inside this tree.
#######################################################

### Selectively patch in these crates, or more, as needed depending on your dev activity
