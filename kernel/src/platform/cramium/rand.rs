/// TRNG ports on the Cramium implementation, it means that userspace applications
/// have to extract random numbers from the kernel through the SID request mechanism.
/// This is ostensibly harmless, if everything is implemented well, but if there is
/// a problem it does mean that the state of the kernel TRNG is disclosed to userspace.
/// What can you do though, this chip just has one TRNG.
///
/// The final implementation for user applications is recommended to have a supplementary
/// noise source in addition to the on-chip noise source, so that user applications
/// combine both the feed from the kernel and the supplementary source to seed a CSPRNG.
///
/// This particular application doesn't trust the on-chip TRNG so much: it takes
/// values from the TRNG and folds them into a seed pool that is then groomed by
/// a ChaCha8 RNG CSPRNG. Every request for a random number folds another 32 bits
/// from the TRNG into the CSPRNG pool, so even if the TRNG is fairly poor, quite
/// rapidly the pool of numbers should diverge. However, from the kernel's perspective,
/// it will function correctly even if the CSPRNG is fully deterministic, it just isn't
/// secure against attackers trying to guess a server address.
