# Relase 0.9 notes

This release signals the stabilization of most Xous APIs; however, we reserve
the right to make breaking changes, but with some justification. You could call
this a "beta" release.

Notably, in 0.9, we have `libstd` integrated into Xous, and solidly intergated
into several servers; thus this release is not backward compatible with 0.8 (and
was never intended to be).

Aside from the introduction of `libstd`, few other breaking changes were implemented
in the APIs. Thus, we refer you to the [0.8 release notes](https://github.com/betrusted-io/xous-core/blob/main/RELEASE-v0.8.md#xous-08-messaging-api-in-practice)
for examples of idiomatic ways to write code for Xous.

## Major new features of 0.9
- Xous now targets `riscv32-imac-uknown-xous-elf` instead of `riscv32-imac-unknown-none-elf`.
  - `cargo xtask`, when run interactively, will offer to install the `xous` target.
  - Kernel debug primitives are accessible via the kernel console
  - GDB improvements
  - Improved `MemoryRange` API
  - Various stability improvements and major bug fixes (ELF loader bugs, stack pointer alignment, etc.)
  - Elimination of `heapless` crate
  - Transition from `master`->`main` for the default branch
- All hardware drivers are available in some form:
  - AES (using VexRiscV CPU extensions)
  - Audio Codec (low-level interface only, 8kHz rec/playback)
  - Curve25519 accelerator
  - SHA512 (based on Google's OpenTitan core)
  - JTAG self-introspection drivers
  - Real time Clock
  - FLASH memory writing
  - Suspend/Resume
  - Clock throttling when idle
  - TRNG upgraded with health monitoring and CSPRNG whitener
  - Upgrades to previous drivers (keyboard, graphics, etc.)
  - Wifi enhancements including SSID scanning and AP join commands
- Secured boot flow:
  - Signed gateware, loader and kernel
  - Compatible with BBRAM and eFuse keyed gateware images
  - Semi-automated BBRAM key burning
  - Self-provisioning of root keys (update and boot unlock keys)
  - Local re-encryption of gateware updates to a secret key known only to your device
  - Re-signing of loader/OS updates to protect code-at-rest
  - Detection of image "downgrade" attacks that use developer keys
  - Indication of downgrade through hardware-enforced hash marks on the status bar
- Enhanced graphical user interface primitives:
  - Modal dialog boxes
  - Menus
  - Progress bars
  - Text and password entry forms with input validators
  - Radio buttons
  - Check boxes
  - Notifications
  - Defacement of less secure items: random hashes on background areas; complicates phishing attacks that present fake UI elements
- Enforcement of delimited attack surfaces
  - `xous-names` can optionally enforce a fixed number of connections to a server
    - Once all the connections are occupied after boot, new connections are no longer possible
    - Developers must increment the connection count, specified inside the target server itself, when adding new resources that require server access
  - `gam` enforces a registry of all UX elements
    - Rogue processes cannot create new trusted UX resources
    - Developers must register their UX tokens in the `gam` inside `tokens.rs`
- Extended simulation support
  - Hosted mode performance improvements
  - Hosted mode now supports thread creation with `std::thread::spawn()`
- Improved emulation in Renode
  - Full emulation of ENGINE
  - Full emulation of SHA512 block
  - Initial support of emulation of EC
    - No COM-based inter-chip communication yet

## New in 0.9.5
- `modals` server for a simple "Pure Rust" API for creating dialog boxes and getting user input. See the `tests.rs` file for some examples how to use the applcation calls.

## New in 0.9.6
- Networking: DNS, UDP, Ping and TCP
  -  Basic demo of ping, rudimentary http get/serve
  -  EC offload of ARP and DHCP – thanks to samblenny for adding that, along with a solid refactor of the EC code base! The EC now also has the capability to act as a coarse packet filter for the core CPU.
- Connection manager
  -  Maintains a list of known SSID/password combos
  -  Manages passive SSID scanning and re-connection
  -  Enrolling in and saving a network profile is done via shellchat's wlan series of commands
  -  Only WPA2 is supported
  -  Still a lot of corner cases to work through
- PDDB: Plausibly Deniable DataBase for system config and user data storage.
  -  Uniform filesystem for all user-specific Xous data
  -  Fully encrypted database
  -  Plausibly deniable secret overlays
  -  See this blog post for more details
  -  Rust API bindings available, but as of now, few command line tools
- EC events – asynchronous callbacks triggered by network and battery events
- CPU load monitor in status bar
- Improved fonts
  -  B/W display optimized emoji
  -  Chinese-native Hanzi glyphs
  -  Japanese-native Kanji glyphs
  -  Hangul glyph set
  -  Thanks again to samblenny for all the hard work to make a slick new set of glyphs and a smooth new API!
- Japanese locale
- AZERTY and QWERTZ layouts
- Auto word-wrapping in the TextView objects
- Simplified graphical abstractions
  -  Modal server: create notifications, checkboxes, progress bars, radio boxes, and text entry boxes with validators using a single API call
  -  Simplified menu API
- Modular application programs
  -  manifest.json file to specify application integration parameters, such as the localized name and app launcher menu name
  -  Build-time command line selection of which apps you want baked into the Xous image
- Many bug fixes and improvements
- Improved libstd support
- Improved Renode and Hosted mode support

## New in 0.9.7
- `pddb` has salamanders fixed (https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1456.pdf). This changes the root basis record storage, causing all prior versions to be unrecognized.
- `betrusted-soc` was updated to the latest Litex in prep for some work optimizing CPU performance and USB cores

## New in 0.9.8
- `TcpStream` is now part of `libstd`. Legacy TcpStream has been removed.
- `TcpListener` is now part of `libstd`. Legacy TcpListener has been removed.
- `net server` demo program has been upgraded to use multiple worker threads + MPSC for communications. Users can now attempt to access `buzz/` to cause the vibration motor to run, and there is now a 404 response for pages not found.
- `UdpSocket` is now part of `libstd`. DNS and all test routines switched over to `libstd`, and all prior scaffolding implementations have been removed.
- `NetPump` call added after Tx (UDP/TCP) and connect (TCP) events. This should improve the transmit latency.
- `Duration` and `Instant` are now part of `libstd`
- Timezone and time setting has been refactored. The HW RTC is now simply treated as a seconds counter since arbitrary time in the past; the BCD data that the hardware device tries to return is mapped into seconds since epoch. On first boot or invalid RTC detection, a random time is picked since epoch as the offset, between 1-10 years, to provide some deniability about how long the device has been used.
- One can now switch the local time by just updating the Timezone offset. The actual timezone offsets are not dynamically updated with DST; one has to explicitly program in the offset from UTC upon daylight savings.
- NTP option for time setting introduced with fallback to manual option
- CPU load meter has been shifting around in the `status` bar to accommodate worst-case proportional font layouts. Maybe we're there?
- Focus events refactored for the GAM to only send to apps (and not to menus and dialogs); it is strongly encouraged that all apps take advantage of them.
- Sleep screen is now blanked of all prior content and just the sentinel message is held
- Sleep/suspend lightly refactored to fix some bugs. Ticktimer is now the sole `Last` event.
- Preliminary text to speech (TTS) support added; compile with `cargo xtask tts` or set the LOCALE to `en-tts` to try it out.
- QR code rendering option added to `modals` (thank you nworbnhoj!)
- Introduce deferred-response pattern into modals, pddb, and susres.
- `pddb` critical bug fixed where page table entries were not having their journal numbers synchronized with the free space table when read off of the disk. This would cause inconsistency glitches in the `pddb`. This release fixes the problem, but, it may require you to reformat the `pddb` once the patch is in place. Because this is a genuine bug, if you're unlucky to be hit by this, there is no effective migration path. :(
- `pddb` major bug fixed where zero-length file allocations were not being committed to disk.
- `pddb` revision bumped to v2.1:
  - A first problem was identified where a key was being re-used between the ECB page table cipher and the AES-GCM-SIV data cipher
  - HKDF is now used to derive two separate keys for each
  - A second problem was identified where the virtual page number was being stored as a fully expanded address in the paget able, and not as a page number. Due to the compressed encoding of the page table entry, this means that the virtual address space would be shrunk by ~4000x. This is now fixed, so we have the full as-designed virtual memory space once again.
  - A migration routine was created to go from v1 -> v2 databases. It automatically detects the older version and attempts to guide the user through a migration. Although we don't have many users and databases today, this is a "best practice" for breaking revisions and this serves as a basis for forward-looking changes that are migrateable.
- Various fixes and improvements to the USB update scripts to improve reliability.
- Graphical panic outputs: when there is a panic, you get a "Guru Meditation" error box plus the panic message.
  - Currently all panics are hard crashes
  - Most of the time the system will reboot itself within a few seconds of displaying the panic
  - There will be occassions where you will need to insert a paperclip into the reset port on the lower right hand corner to recover from the panic.
  - If you get a panic, please snap a photo of it and drop it in a new issue in the `xous-core` repo, along with a description of what you were doing at the time.

## New in 0.9.9
This release requires a new SoC. It is highly recommended to first upload the SoC and install the update, and then
perform the Xous firmware upgrade. This requires running manual update commands, instead of the all-in-one updater script.

- `modals` text entry has been refactored to allow multi-field text entries with defaults! Thanks to gsora for PR #140.
- fix issue #141: bug fix in `log-server` where max-length buffers were not being printed + refactor of method to use `send` vs scalars
- PR #149: index support for modals. Lists can be submitted as a `Vec` now, with an array index returned as the selection result. Thanks to nworbnhoj for the PR.
- PR #150 & #153: QR codes can now display a separate QR code from the actual text in the box via a Some/None specifier. Thanks to nworbnhoj for the PR & refinements.
- PR #151: message forwarding standardized as part of the messaging API. See https://betrusted.io/xous-book/ch07-07-forwarding.html
- fixed locking bug in dlmalloc (stdlib version 1.60.0.7)
- update smoltcp to 0.8.1
- refactor wait threads in net crate - use statically allocated pool of waiters + better filtering of requests for less churn
- defer Drop on TcpStream until all written packets have been transmitted
- scheduler quantum is now a tuning parameter in xous definitions.rs (`BASE_QUANTA_MS`). it is now set to 10ms, down from 20ms.
- USB device core with keyboard HID emulation demo and FIDO2 HID support; fix issue #170
- Issue #162 and #159: fix bugs with condvar support. condvar IDs are now serial, so re-allocations are not a problem, and the routine to remove old ones from the notification table now looks at the correct sender ID.
- Add `ceil`, `floor`, and `trunc` (f32 and f64) variants to the built-ins list (this is a `std` lib update, in 1.61.0.2)
- Add CI test automation facilities - CI infra now drives actual hardware through `expect` scripts, instead of just doing simulation checks
- Vendor in `getrandom` so we can support a Xous API for the crate, allowing us access some of the more modern rustcrypto APIs. This is necssary for `randcore` 0.6 compatibility. `randcore` 0.5 APIs are retained by integrating them directly into the TRNG object.
- Update AES API level to 0.8, and cipher dependency to 0.4 (on rootkeys). This was necessary to get CBC support for AES, which is needed for FIDO2. This *should* have no user-facing impact.
- `vault` app: a user authentication management app is now ready for Alpha testing. It aims to provide FIDO2, TOTP, and stored password DB functions.
  - U2F/FIDO2 are a vendor-in of Google OpenSK's FIDO2 implementation. The code basically passes the CTAP2 test suite (https://github.com/google/CTAP2-test-tool) ("basically passes" in that the timeouts tests fail because they aren't automated to not "press the button" when timeouts are being tested).
  - U2F functions are best supported with UX flow. FIDO2 transactions still trying to figure out what the UX flow is even supposed to be:
    we're lacking actual FIDO2 applications to test against. Some prompts are still just stand-in text.
  - TOTP integration is thanks to blakesmiths's PoC TOTP code!
  - Password vault functionality in place
  - Test routine for adding dozens of TOTP/FIDO records and a hundred passwords added. System tested up to 300 passwords -- no crash observed, but query performance of the PDDB is slow (~8 seconds)
- Strip out gratuitous use of floating point -- this trims about 100k overall from the memory footprint.
- Autobacklight feature: selectable feature to automatically raise the backlight when keys are pressed. Thanks to gsora for the feature!
  - More importantly, this adds `crossbeam` into the kernel. This is a somewhat heavyweight item and is not recommended for use in core
    services, but by including it to drive the auto-backlight feature, we get regular code coverage of the condvar pathway.
- Fix PDDB FSCB generation problems
  - some issue were found in free space cache generation, these are now fixed
  - fuzzer added to push many more corner cases than before -- disk is filled to ~75% capacity with dozens of Bases,
    triggering roughly 4 FSCB ops, and then all Bases and keys are verified to be correct.
- Optimize GAM performance
  - context switches that revert to a prior app screen are restored from a stashed bitmap instead of a full redraw. This
    prevents old menus, contexts, and defacements from "piling up" when an app is blocked due to an exceptional condition
    being raised (such as the PDDB requesting a full basis unlock to generate the FSCB)
- PDDB support in libstd
  - Directories are implemented as dicts in the flat namespace
  - The `:` separator is used between path components
  - A path that begins with a `:` specifies a basis. That is, the path `example` specifies a dict in the Union basis, while the path `:.System:example` specifies a dict `example` in the basis `.System`.
  - A path that is only `:` specifies `all bases`, and is used to list the open bases
  - The path `::` specifies the "default basis", which is the most recently-opened one
  - Because the path delimiter is `:`, this cannot be used as a string in filenames
    - Note, however, that the underlying API allows for `:` in filenames, which will confuse the libstd API
  - It is possible for a "file" and a "directory" with the same name to exist in the same "directory". In this case, the entity will return `true` for both `.is_file()` and `.is_directory()`. In practice this doesn't matter, since there are different calls for working with files and directories.
  - When deleting a file, it is immediately deleted and all open file handles on the system are now invalid. This is in contrast to other platforms where open file handles still work, or where a file that is open cannot be deleted.
  - It is not yet possible to create or delete bases using this API.
  - Libstd support for PDDB is not possible with hosted mode. File operations will write to your local filesystem.
- BIP39 wordlist handling
  - Display of BIP39 words from a `[u8]`
  - Input of BIP39 words into a `[u8]`, with validation and dynamic lookup/autocomplete of words
- Improved kernel revisioning
  - A readable semantic version tag is appended to loader and kernel images
  - In addition to the current tag, a tag for "minimum xous version" to read a PDDB backup generated by the current Xous image is included.
- Backup and restore of the PDDB
  - PDDB can now be backed up via USB. An encryption key, coded in BIP-39 words, is displayed on the screen.
  - Likewise, the PDDB can be restored onto any device, so long as you have the encryption key.
  - Restoration of the PDDB to a brand new device will require a "rekey" step that migrates the PDDB to the device-specific DNA code.
  - Most deniability is lost in the event of a rekey migration (only about 10% of the disk free space is fake-rekeyed for performance reasons). If full deniability is desired, one can run `pddb churn` after the migration to fully re-cycle all the ciphertext in the PDDB, and regain full deniability (but it can take up to 10x longer to run than a simple rekey).
- Auto-update flow
  - Staged updates are now automatically applied, or at least the user is prompted to enter passwords and apply them.
  - Devices with no passwords prompt users to create them, at least the very first time.
- Clarifications to terminology
  - Various menus and items clarified to be easier to read/understand. In particular:
    - The term "FPGA key" is now "backup key"
    - The term "update password" is now "root password"
    - The term "root keys" (as in "init root keys") is now simply referred to as "passwords" (as in "setup passwords")
    - The new terms are less pedantic but hopefully more intuitive

## New in 0.9.10
- Host-side updates are now simplified.
  - There is just one script to run on all platforms: `precursorupdater`
  - The old factory_reset.[sh,ps1] and update_ci scripts are now deprecated, and will be permanently removed next release.
  - `precursorupdater` is [published to PyPi](https://pypi.org/project/precursorupdater/) with the help of neutralinsomniac to sort out the packaging issues via #204. Thank you!
- PDDB fixes:
  - root structure journal age bug fixed & pushed as hotfix to v0.9.9
  - periodic flush of FSCB SpaceUpdate records added to restore deniability
  - Shellchat commands for flush, sync, and write added to the pddb subcommand
  - `backalyzer` script added to analyze backups. Useful for debug & recovery of data.
  - Fixed aes-keywrap bug - OG library was faulty; swapped in one that passes NIST test vectors & added transparent migration.
- Net fixes (`std` testbench compliance):
  - added loopback interface by "faking it" over the COM as smoltcp does not yet have the feature (loops back packets and ARP packets)
  - `net test` command added when the nettest feature is turned on
  - get error codes into compliance with library expcectations
  - add nonblocking feature
  - fix Peek
  - fix short reads -- no more discarding of excess data when the read buffer is shorter than the data in the buffer
  - fix TcpClose -- waits until the close handshake finishes before removing the socket
  - handle "unattended" closes -- this is when someone connects to a server and immediately disconnects, so the application layer never has time to issue a "formal" close request. Now it is automatically issued.
  - fix timeouts
- `ditherpunk` improvements (PR #207):
  - iterator form for PNG decoding (thanks to nworbnhoj for a ton of work to get that together)
  - memory usage is well-constrained now, and suitable for everyday use
  - primary limit to PNG decode speed is read speed over e.g. TCP
- Feature #211 (change unlock PIN) implemented
  - The menu item is in the PDDB Submenu->Change unlock PIN
  - The redundant boot PIN setting during first power on setup is also removed. Only the one you set when you init the PDDB matters.
- vault backup restore (PR #205):
  - backup and restore of TOTP + password records to a host device via USB implemented by gsora. Huge thanks, that was a massive effort! lots of refactoring of the internal data structures used by the vault, making them more idiomatic.
  - separate host-based tool currently located at `apps/vault/tools/vaultbackup-rs` must be run on the host side to perform the backup
  - data is stored on the host as JSON; users can format their own JSON records to import existing TOTP and password data to the device in a bulk command
  - BitWarden export format is also supported by `vaultbackup-rs`.
  - backup and restore can only be run with user approval, accessed via the `vault` context menu and then selecting `Enable host readout`. Note that in this mode, any host can read vault secrets; therefore, the mode locks out the UI and when it is active.
- highly experimental TLS support when the "tls" feature is enabled. Relies on a pure-Rust implementation of `ring` located in the `ring-xous` fork.
- performance monitoring framework added. see `tools/perflib` and `services/shellchat/net_cmd.rs` for examples of how to use it.
- HOTP support added to `vault`. HOTPs display in the TOTP window with the notation "HOTP" next to them, and they auto-increment on autotype. When creating new items in TOTP you are given the option to make an HOTP record, and you can convert between the two by editing the record and changing the bottom line from totp to hotp and vice-versa. The `timestep` field is re-used from the TOTP record to store the `count` for HOTP.
- `ball` app demo removed from default build
- WLAN submenu added, thanks to a huge effort by @gsora.
- fix/close various old issues (in particular, RTC interrupts stripped out and suspend lock fails now trigger a notification)
- move RTC resume handler to the secure/private server - hopefully resolves a susres failure case
- `xtask` cleanup
  - old/unused targets removed
  - code refactored to use builder patterns and to be more modular
  - better support for remote packages and pre-built artifacts in the build system
- Cleanup to facilitate more targets that Precursor:
  - `api` directory created.
    - `ticktimer`, `log-server`, `xous-names`, and `susres` split into api/implementation pairs
  - `xous-kernel`, `xous-ipc`, `xous-rs` updated, packaged, and pushed to crates.io; kernel has gdb-stub removed since it doesn't work and creates a crates.io incompatible dependency.
  - `utralib` refactored to be the domicile for platform-specific artifacts:
    - SVD files are now located here
    - `renode`, `hosted`, `precusor` targets now added
    - targets are selected by a feature flag passed through the build system
- Added a sanity check to the backup.py to make sure that the backup preparation was run: you must prepare backups every time before doing a backup. The exported key headers are erased after the backup is run, because you don't want the exported keys just laying around where anyone can read it out by plugging in a USB cable. Unfortunately, a user lost data because this check was missing :(
- Added crates.io package verification to `xtask`. Note: Cargo.toml files are munged by `cargo publish`, so it's difficult to prove equivalence of your source file and what you're sent from crates.io. Instead, there's now a check in CI to confirm that Cargo.lock did not change, which should change with a tampered Cargo.toml.
- Fixed cache coherence issue in FLASH. Writes to flash memory need to also invalidate D$ because they are out of band to the regular memory hierarchy.

## Roadmap to 1.0

- Lots of testing and bug fixes
- Understanding what the gap is to get TLS working
- Fixing performance issues in `pddb`
- Refactoring `modals` to not have N^2 space growth with feature set
